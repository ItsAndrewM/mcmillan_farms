The farm was already operating a small dairy and contained some of Kelowna's earliest European settlement history. After years of hard work with son Jim, they built up one of the largest dairy operations in the Kelowna area, producing milk for the Kelowna Creamery and eventually North Okanagan Creamery Association (NOCA). Ross and Jean retired from the dairy business in the early 1970's, but Ross and Jim continued the operation as a hay farm."
